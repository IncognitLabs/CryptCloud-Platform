## Welcome to CryptCloud!

### What is CryptCloud?

CryptCloud is a platform as a service (PaaS) designed by [OTR Labs](https://github.com/OTRLabs) for hackers, pen-testers, cybersecurity researchers, red teams, and other offensive (or defensive) cyber organizations!

In concept, it aims to be a sort of “everything” app for red teams. In reality, it will most likely act as a “god of the gaps” and fill in any holes in your workflow that you don’t already have a better tool for.

> **Note:** CryptCloud is designed to be used by multiple organizations! This setup can be both demanding and unnecessary for some organizations! If you are not interested in running CryptCloud as a cluster, we suggest running a standalone CryptHub instance.

Everything you need to know about the platform is available in a Foam-based Wiki or at [docs.cryptcloud.cc](https://docs.cryptcloud.cc).

#### CryptHub | Standalone Workspace for CryptCloud

CryptHub is the core component of the CryptCloud platform. CryptCloud essentially serves as a management system for multiple instances of CryptHub.
