## WELCOME TO CRYPTCLOUD!


### WHAT IS CRYPTCLOUD?

CryptCloud is a platform as a service (PaaS) designed by OTR Labs
[https://github.com/OTRLabs] for hackers, pen-testers cyber security
researchers, red teams, and other offensive (or defensive) cyber organizations!

In concept, it aims to be a sort of “everything” app for red teams.

In reality it will most likely act as a “god of the gaps” and fill in any holes
in your workflow that you don’t already have a better tool for.



> It should be noted, CryptCloud is designed to be used by multiple organizations! This setup can be both demanding and unnecessary for some organizations! If you are not interested in running CryptCloud as a cluster, then we suggest running a standalone CryptHub instance!
